Introducing Portable Storage 3 Fluids.

A mod that provides you with a variety of fluid containers to store your liquids.

Bucket: Stores 10 buckets of liquids
Drum: Stores 100 buckets of liquids
Tank: Stores 1000 buckets of liquids

Fluid containers act like adjacent liquids, that means you can craft stuff like Bottled Honey without having to get stung by bees!
Any recipe that uses filled buckets will be able to use liquids from fluid containers instead, and you will save some iron!
